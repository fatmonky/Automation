# Automation
My scripts to automate certain tasks. I'm using Python, as I am reading & using the scripts from [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), which I have tweaked & adapted for my own purposes. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**.

## Desktop Screenshot Organizer
This script looks for all files starting with "Screenshot" in the desktop, and moves them to a folder "Screenshots" in the Desktop.

If the Screenshots folder doesn't exist, it creates the folder in Desktop. 

**Requirements**

This requires Python 3.x to be installed in your system. In the command-line, type _python3 --version_ to see the Python version you have on your command line. 
The script requires you to type in the full absolute path of your Desktop directory e.g. /Users/pjteh/Desktop. Go to your Desktop, and type _pwd_ to see your Desktop directory's full path. 

**Usage**
1. Go to the directory where you downloaded the script. 
2. Type _python3 script_name.py_
